# WTWR (What to Wear?): Back-End

[DEPLOYED PROJECT](https://wtwr.base.crabdance.com/)

The back-end project for the **WTWR (What to Wear?)** application serves as the server-side logic and data management for user profiles and clothing item interactions. This API enables core operations like creating, reading, updating, and deleting users and items, as well as handling user interactions with items such as liking or unliking them.

## Overview

This back-end API is designed to:
- Manage user profiles with features like creating and fetching user data.
- Handle clothing item data, including adding, retrieving, deleting, and liking/unliking items.
- Provide error handling with appropriate HTTP status codes to ensure a smooth user experience.
- Routes protected by authorization.

## Features

### User Routes

- **Get My Info**: Retrieves authorized user info.
- **Change My Info**: Changes authorized user `name` and `avatar` fields.

### Item Routes

- **Get All Items**: Retrieves all clothing items, each populated with the ownerâ€™s information.
- **Get Item by ID**: Fetches an item by its `itemId`, with error handling for missing or invalid IDs.
- **Create Item**: Adds a new clothing item with details such as `name`, `weather` (categorized as "hot," "warm," or "cold"), and `imageUrl` (must be a valid URL).
- **Delete Item**: Removes a clothing item based on its `itemId` and requires authorized user to be the owner of the item.
- **Like/Unlike Item**: Allows users to like or unlike items, updating the list of users who have liked the item.

### Signin and Signup Routes

- **Signin**: Logs in user with `email` and `password` and responds with json web token.
- **Signup**: Creates new user with `name`, `avatar`, `email` and `password`.

### Data Models

- **User Model**: Defines a schema with `name`, `avatar`, `email` and `password` fields, where `avatar` requires a valid URL format, email is unique and password stored in hashed value.
- **Clothing Item Model**: Contains properties for `name`, `weather`, `imageUrl`, `owner`, `likes`, and `createdAt`. Validation rules ensure appropriate field lengths, valid URLs, and user tracking in the `likes` array.

## Technologies Used
- **Node.js** and **Express.js**: Server setup and routing.
- **MongoDB** and **Mongoose**: Database and data modeling.
- **Validator**: For validating fields such as URLs.
- **dotenv**: Environment variable management.

## Setup and Running the Project

To run this project locally:

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/NikitaStambul/se_project_express.git
   cd se_project_express
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Environment Variables**:
   - Create a `.env` file in the project root and add your environment variables such as `PORT` and `DATABASE_URL`.

4. **Start the Server**:
   - For production:
     ```bash
     npm run start
     ```
   - For development with hot-reloading:
     ```bash
     npm run dev
     ```

## Development

This project uses [Nodemon](https://nodemon.io/) for auto-reloading during development, allowing the server to restart automatically whenever file changes are detected.
